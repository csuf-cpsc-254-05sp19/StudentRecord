Overview of the Project
This program named- “Report Card Management System”, includes provisions for 
adding, deleting, displaying and various other functions on student records. 
All the records are saved to data files. The project was developed for Windows 
systems using the Dev C++ IDE. It was compiled using the mingw32-gccg++ 
complier - Version 6.3.0-1.


Goal of the Software 
The goal of the software is to help teachers and students manage report cards 
in an organized manner. We will learn and use the resources and implement them 
into the existing project. The team agreed to add more objects and a 
functionality where the teacher and student can have access to what score 
they got for each subject. If we are interested in adding more functionality, 
then we will proceed to do so.
